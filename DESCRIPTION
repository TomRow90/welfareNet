Description: This package is mostly a wrapper around other packages to ease network analyses for applied researchers.
    Specifically, it contains functions to estimate networks (the main one being a network of partial distance correlations), 
    to identify possible node redundancies by use of a simple function that estimates zero-order correlations,  
    to compare networks with a permutation test (network moderation analysis), and performs network intervention analysis. 
    It also contains a very basic plotting function.
