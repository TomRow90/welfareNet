\details{
Note that in the returned objects/results, both the P and S value are supplied. For dissimilarity
the P value is one-sided, for all other network descriptors it is two-sided. The S value is also
known as the surprisal value and is simply calculated as -log2(P value). It converts the P value
into binary 'bits' of information against the test hypothesis and can be interpreted in the context
of flipping a coin. That is, a P value of 0.05 as an S value is 4.32, rounded to the nearest integer
we can say that assuming the null hypothesis (and all other assumptions) are true, then the result
is as surprising as getting 4 heads in a row in a series of coin tosses. See Rafi and Greenland (2020)
for more information and explanation about the surprisal value (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01105-9).
